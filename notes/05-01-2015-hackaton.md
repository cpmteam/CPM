#CPM - CachÃ© Package Manager
===

## Notes of hackaton decisions

1. Need any container - XML ok
2. at the moment using xml for metainfo: i.e. metainfo.xml
   - later on may use JSON, or TOML
3. Fields in `metainfo.xml` will be modelled using `package.json` as example;
4. build should be available for source code modules written in C/C++
5. unit-testing is required for such modules
6. Unit-testing: there no unit-testing in `package.json`, should introduce something similar to Perl CPAN
7. command-line package manager is BAT wrapper calling COS shell;
8. it should be generalized similar to pl2bat which convert COS script to BAT executable;
9. site :  there will be 2 parts:
 - dynamic part where upload;
 - static part on CDN;
10. We need good examples:
  * iknowSocial - *good*;
  * Atom-COS-Studio - mixed (*bad*)
  * webterminal - *good*
  * CNA - binary (*bad*)
  * coslint - OBJ (*good* for _deployed mode_)

%CPM is accessible everywhere
```
> d ^%CPM
 #install package ; install localy
 #install global package ; install globally to %ALL
```
