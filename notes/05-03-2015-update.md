#CPM - CachÃ© Package Manager
===

### Miscelanea

Dmitry Maslennikov will go to Global Summit
* Timur needs to prepare modified CPM presentation, to have it ready for preparations. Just in case, if chance arise;

### Branches status

Timur will push the current branch feature/package_from_prj state right away;
* Although it's not feature complete - it's not generating package from prj yet;

Tried to work with `npm publish` using the exported/manually modified package. Still do not work for Timur npm/node version;

Timur has those versions (which are broken):
```
	C:\InterSystems\CacheLatest\.cpm>npm --version
	1.4.9
	
	C:\InterSystems\CacheLatest\.cpm>node --version
	v0.10.28
```

Dmitry has newer npm version v2.* so node should be updated to bring newer npm version. Latest for Windows is this;

```
	C:\InterSystems\CacheLatest\.cpm>npm --version
	2.5.1
	
	C:\InterSystems\CacheLatest\.cpm>node --version
	v0.12.0
```

* It worked for npm publish!
	* `npm adduser --registry https://cpmisc.smileupps.com`
	* `npm login --registry https://cpmisc.smileupps.com`
	* `npm publish --registry https://cpmisc.smileupps.com`

* Here are know prerequisites to make it working:
	* npm version v2.*
	* All attributes in package.json in lower case
	* Package name should be normalized (lower case)

There are plenty of fixes still were not committed at the moment by Dmitry which were done in registry branch. 
* He has merged and committed them later this night

So this is quite a semi-milestone:
* We published newer, exported package from cpm to the site;
* And this newer name is available for search from `cpm search`
* Container is published to CouchDB also as .tgz (put inside under package/*.xml)
