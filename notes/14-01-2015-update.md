## Notes of 14.01.2015 meeting updates decisions

### Dependencies

* Circular dependencies?
	* Reject?
		- [X] Decided to reject to be bullet-proof;
	* Or load all classes first and then compile;
		* Could we introduce compile after?
			* Not all time
	* Eventually refactor as classes
	* Make it format agnostic (xml, json, toml, whatever)
	* Build unknown dependencies tree in topological sort

### Manual package creating
  - [ ] Create
  - [ ]  Add item
  - [ ]  Export
  - [ ]  dependency
  - [ ]  Write/package
  - [ ]  Unittest
  - [ ]  verify
    * Longer way
	
  - [ ]  Import project
    * Verify actuality?
  - [ ]  Load project
  - [ ]  Import manifest
  - [ ]  Reinstall package?
  - [ ]  Write package
  - [ ]  Push package (to repo)
    * When to do install?
    * With dependencies?

### Procedure matter
* we want to use obligatory peer-review eventually;
* since now on we use feature branches for development;
* and pull requests to the master for pre-commit code review by other party
